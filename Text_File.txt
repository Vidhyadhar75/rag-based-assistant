Best Practices:

two best practices successfully implemented as per NAAC - Title 1: Holistic Development of Students through Community Engagement -  
This practice aims to bridge the gap between education and real-world action by involving students in rural community engagement. Through a 21-day internship, students identify challenges in sectors like agriculture, healthcare, and sanitation, work on innovative solutions, and develop prototypes using Design Thinking and FAB labs. The initiative fosters entrepreneurial skills, social responsibility, and technological innovation, with over 16,000 students empowered, 1,000 prototypes developed, and 50 patents secured. Challenges include resource allocation, community engagement, and placement opportunities.

Title 2-Comprehensive Green Campus Initiatives 
This initiative promotes sustainability within campus operations by implementing green practices in construction, water management, waste disposal, and energy use. Key actions include tree planting, efficient water treatment, waste recycling, and energy-efficient infrastructure. Student-led sustainability projects focus on green technologies. The university has received over 13 prestigious awards for its environmental efforts, though challenges such as infrastructure investment and behavioral change remain. Resources needed include funding, training, and community engagement. 

Institutional Distinctiveness:
Our university bridges the gap between academia and industry by identifying in-demand skills through collaborations with industries and surveys.
